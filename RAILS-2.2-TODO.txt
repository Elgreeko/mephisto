This is a list of issues that we need to fix before making a Mephisto
release based on Rails 2.2.

/ Try to upgrade to gem version of coderay
  Make sure both old- and new-style plugins work
  Security audit--see blow
  Drop TZInfo completely--see app/models/site.rb (fix docs, too)
  We need to review our TODO comments

== Security

We need to do a basic security audit.

  Cookies
    Make sure cookies are HTTP-only whenever possible
    Can we restrict admin cookies to /admin ?
    Make sure logging out clears all relevant cookies and tokens
    Check for session fixation attacks
    Expire sessions after a while?
  Cross-site scripting
/   Turn on protect_against_forgery
    Check all fields in comments
      It looks like the failed comment error form has issues
    Check macro:* bodies and parameters
      filtered_column_code_macro
      filtered_column_flikr_macro
    Do we have trackback support to check?
    Do we need to upgrade to an industrial-strength HTML sanitizer?
    For now, we'll assume that users with access to /admin don't try XSS
  Password change
    Make change-password forms safe against CSRF
    Require the user to enter the old password when changing it
    Require password to change e-mail address
  Everything else
/   Don't ship :session_key in environment.rb!
    Do we need to override verifiable_request_format?
    Review mass assignment in public controllers
    Review http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html
    Can we use SafeERB?

  Admin only
    Filter file names for uploads
    Review mass assignment in admin controllers

== After next release

  Handle inactive users with named scopes, not acts_as_versioned
  Clean out the issue tracker
    http://ar-code.lighthouseapp.com/projects/34-mephisto
  rake rails:update:javascripts
    (complicated because mephisto/application.js depends on older versions)
  Fix sidebar tabs to do something sensible with unsaved articles
