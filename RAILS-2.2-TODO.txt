This is a list of issues that we need to fix before making a Mephisto
release based on Rails 2.2.

  Drop TZInfo completely--see app/models/site.rb (fix docs, too)
  Handle inactive users with named scopes, not acts_as_versioned
  SECURITY: Don't ship :session_key in environment.rb!
  Try to upgrade to gem version of coderay
  We need to review our TODO comments
