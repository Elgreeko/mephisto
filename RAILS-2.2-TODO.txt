This is a list of issues that we need to fix before making a Mephisto
release based on Rails 2.2.

/ Try to upgrade to gem version of coderay
/ Fix TZInfo to work again
  Make sure we know what's up with plugins
  Security audit--see below
  We need to review our TODO comments

== Security

We need to do a basic security audit.

  Cookies
X   Can we restrict admin cookies to /admin ? No--need /accounts, too.
/   Make sure logging out clears all relevant cookies and tokens
/   Check for session fixation attacks
/   Make sure cookies are HTTP-only whenever possible
    Expire sessions after a while?
  Cross-site scripting
/   Turn on protect_against_forgery
    Check all fields in comments
      It looks like the failed comment error form has issues
    Check macro:* bodies and parameters
      filtered_column_code_macro
      filtered_column_flikr_macro
    Do we have trackback support to check?
    Do we need to upgrade to an industrial-strength HTML sanitizer?
    For now, we'll assume that users with access to /admin don't try XSS
  Password change
    Make change-password forms safe against CSRF
    Require the user to enter the old password when changing it
      This will break our password reset system, actually
    Require password to change e-mail address?
  Everything else
/   Don't ship :session_key in environment.rb!
/   Do we need to override verifiable_request_format? No.
    Check redirection in lib/authenticated_system.rb
    Review mass assignment in public controllers
    Check regexes for ^ and $
    Review http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html

  Admin only
    Filter file names for uploads
    Review mass assignment in admin controllers
    Can we use SafeERB?

== Mass assignment protection

# We need to modify this and put somewhere appropriate.
ActiveRecord::Base.class_eval do
  # Raise an error if mass-assignment occurs during unit tests.  Taken from:
  # http://almosteffortless.com/2008/11/27/raising-protected-attribute-assignme
  def log_protected_attribute_removal(*attributes)
    raise "Can't mass-assign these protected attributes: #{attributes.join(', '
  end
end

== After next release

  Handle inactive users with named scopes, not acts_as_versioned
  Clean out the issue tracker
    http://ar-code.lighthouseapp.com/projects/34-mephisto
  rake rails:update:javascripts
    (complicated because mephisto/application.js depends on older versions)
  Fix sidebar tabs to do something sensible with unsaved articles
